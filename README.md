This is a repository of all work done in my CS-250 class at SNHU.


# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   Testing with people outside of the development team is one of the best ways to "see" how the program will be received. It allows someone who unfamiliar with the product to experience it and give their feedback. User stories are a great way to take that feedback and turn them into a useful format for the development team to work with. 
    
# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
   I would begin developing a program by breaking it up into very small projects so it is a little less overwhelming. Even if I am working alone, I have some ideas on how I can incorporate Scrum methods into my projects. I think it is a good idea to create a product backlog, and organize my program's development into sprints. I don't need a whole team to ask myself how the sprint went and how I can make the next better.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
   I think pulling your weight and doing your best is part of being a good team member. I also think that it is important to offer help to other team members so that the project can move forward. You should also bring the occasional box of donuts, no one can deny that you don't improve morale anyway.
